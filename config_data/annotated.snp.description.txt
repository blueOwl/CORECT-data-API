	VEST3_score: VEST 3.0 score. Score ranges from 0 to 1. The larger the score the more likely
		the mutation may cause functional change. In case there are multiple scores for the 
		same variant, the largest score (most damaging) is presented. Please refer to 
		Carter et al., (2013) BMC Genomics. 14(3) 1-16 for details.
		Please note this score is free for non-commercial use. For more details please refer to 
		http://wiki.chasmsoftware.org/index.php/SoftwareLicense. Commercial users should contact 
		the Johns Hopkins Technology Transfer office.
	VEST3_rankscore: VEST3 scores were ranked among all VEST3 scores in dbNSFP. 
		The rankscore is the ratio of the rank of the score over the total number of VEST3 
		scores in dbNSFP. The scores range from 0 to 1. 
		Please note VEST score is free for non-commercial use. For more details please refer to 
		http://wiki.chasmsoftware.org/index.php/SoftwareLicense. Commercial users should contact 
		the Johns Hopkins Technology Transfer office.
	PROVEAN_score: PROVEAN score (PROVEANori). Scores range from -14 to 14. The smaller the score 
		the more likely the SNP has damaging effect. Multiple scores separated by ";". Details 
		can be found in DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0046688
	PROVEAN_converted_rankscore: PROVEANori were first converted to PROVEANnew=1-(PROVEANori+14)/28, 
		then ranked among all PROVEANnew scores in dbNSFP. The rankscore is the ratio of 
		the rank the PROVEANnew score over the total number of PROVEANnew scores in dbNSFP. 
		If there are multiple scores, only the most damaging (largest) rankscore is presented.
	PROVEAN_pred: If PROVEANori <= -2.5 (rankscore>=0.59) the corresponding NS is 
		predicted as "D(amaging)"; otherwise it is predicted as "N(eutral)". 
		Multiple predictions separated by ";"\n"+
	M-CAP_score: M-CAP score (details in DOI: 10.1038/ng.3703). Scores range from 0 to 1. The larger
		the score the more likely the SNP has damaging effect. 
	M-CAP_rankscore: M-CAP scores were ranked among all M-CAP scores in dbNSFP. The rankscore is
		the ratio of the rank of the score over the total number of M-CAP scores in dbNSFP.
	M-CAP_pred: Prediction of M-CAP score based on the authors' recommendation, "T(olerated)" or
		"D(amaging)". The score cutoff between "D" and "T" is 0.025.\n"+
	REVEL_score: REVEL is an ensemble score based on 13 individual scores for predicting the
		pathogenicity of missense variants. Scores range from 0 to 1. The larger the score the more 
		likely the SNP has damaging effect. "REVEL scores are freely available for non-commercial use.  
		For other uses, please contact Weiva Sieh" (weiva.sieh@mssm.edu)
	REVEL_rankscore: REVEL scores were ranked among all REVEL scores in dbNSFP. The rankscore is
		the ratio of the rank of the score over the total number of REVEL scores in dbNSFP.
	MutPred_score: General MutPred score. Scores range from 0 to 1. The larger the score the more
		likely the SNP has damaging effect.
	MutPred_rankscore: MutPred scores were ranked among all MutPred scores in dbNSFP. The rankscore is
		the ratio of the rank of the score over the total number of MutPred scores in dbNSFP.
	MutPred_protID: UniProt accession or Ensembl transcript ID used for MutPred_score calculation.
	MutPred_AAchange: Amino acid change used for MutPred_score calculation.
	MutPred_Top5features: Top 5 features (molecular mechanisms of disease) as predicted by MutPred with
		p values. MutPred_score > 0.5 and p < 0.05 are referred to as actionable hypotheses.
		MutPred_score > 0.75 and p < 0.05 are referred to as confident hypotheses.
		MutPred_score > 0.75 and p < 0.01 are referred to as very confident hypotheses.");
